# tf2_examples

This repo contains code examples of Deep Neural Networks leveraging TensorFlow 2.0 Core functions. We'll use

- tf.keras: High level API for building deep neural network models
- tf.function: Pre-compile computational graph to get better performance
- tf.GradientTape: Records gradients for automatic differentiation and back-propagation
- tensorflow_datasets: Collection of ready to use datasets for TensorFlow
